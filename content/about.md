About me.

Hi, my name is Manfredi.

I'm an Italian boy of 16 years old who lives in a big city, I have many passions that lead me to live my life to the maximum possible.

My greatest passions are Music (I play the guitar for almost 5 years) Politics (I have been doing politics for several years with a lot of interest in subjects such as philosophy and law) and last but perhaps the most important is computer science and programming.

This Blog in fact aims to tell all the small and big steps of my life towards my dream, to become a software engineer. I will go through all the stages of my day through a post a day that you can find in the posts next to About. 

I'm a sunny and often funny guy, I'm single (and I also suck :)) but that's not very interesting. My favorite saga is STAR WARS and I label myself as a true Nerd.
I want to learn new things and I hope to do it with you too. 

:)
